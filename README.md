# RC-Boat-using-Blynk-Control
RC Boat Blynk Control Using ESP32

This project enables the control of an RC boat using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk IoT platform. The boat is equipped with motors for forward, backward, left, and right movement, as well as a servo to control the rudder. The control interface is provided through the Blynk app, allowing users to operate the boat remotely via virtual buttons.
Key Features:
    Wi-Fi Connectivity: The ESP32 connects to a Wi-Fi network to communicate with the Blynk app.
    Motor Control: Control the boat's movement using forward, backward, left, and right buttons.
    Servo Control: Adjust the rudder position for turning, with servo control to steer the boat.
    Blynk Integration: Use Blynk's virtual pins to control the boat via the mobile app.
    Simple Setup: Easily configurable with your Wi-Fi credentials and Blynk authentication token.

Components:
    ESP32 Microcontroller
    DC motors for movement
    Servo motor for rudder control
    Blynk app for remote control

How to Use:
    Install the Blynk app on your mobile device.
    Set up the project in the Blynk app and get your authentication token.
    Update the Blynk authentication token and Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
    Upload the code to your ESP32 and run the project.
    Control the RC boat using the Blynk app.
