# RC-Boat-using-Blynk-Control
This project allows remote control of an RC boat using an ESP32 and the Blynk app. It controls the boat’s movement (forward, backward, left, right) and steering via a servo. The ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi, and the boat is operated through Blynk’s virtual buttons. Simple setup with Wi-Fi credentials and Blynk token.
